Implementation of the ladder network algorithm in Tensorflow.

This is based on the following:

- The paper [_Semi-Supervised Learning with Ladder Networks_](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02672) by A Rasmus, H Valpola, M Honkala,
M Berglund, and T Raiko.
- [Theano implementation](https://github.com/CuriousAI/ladder) used in the above paper
